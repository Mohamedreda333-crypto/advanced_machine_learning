## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Machine Learning pipeline to predict diabetes based on patient diagnostic measurements. The project covers the entire workflow from deep data exploration (EDA) to deploying high-performance ensemble models.

## Key Stages of the Project
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Detailed visualizations to understand feature distributions and correlations.
2. **Advanced Preprocessing:** - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Feature Scaling and Normalization.
   - Categorical encoding (if applicable).
3. **Model Selection & Training:** - Comparing multiple algorithms: **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.**
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Detailed analysis using **F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and Accuracy.**

## Results Summary
- **Best Performing Models:** Tree-based ensemble models (Random Forest & XGBoost) outperformed others.
- **Key Insight:** Captured complex patterns in data while maintaining low overfitting and high stability.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost.
